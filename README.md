# MechCalculator
A program that calculates unknown variables in projectile motion and collision using user-input parameters, integrating concepts from computer science and mechanics.

# Project Plan

Options:
1. Projectile Motion
2. Collision
3. Falling from a ramp and sliding

1)Projectile Motion
1. what do you want to find out?: vo-vf-a-t-x
2. plug in other variables

2)Collision
1. what type of collision? elastic/inelastic
2. if inelastic: do the objects stick together after colliding?
3. what do you want to find out? vo(a/b)-vf(a/b)-mass(a/b)
4. plug in other variables

3)Falling from a ramp and sliding (assuming there isnâ€™t any friction on the ramp)
1. IS THERE FRICTION on the surface?
2. if true: what is the coefficient of fk?
3. what do you want to find out? h-vf-distance after the ramp-angle theta(??)
4. plug in other variables: mgh=Ffd+mv^2/2
